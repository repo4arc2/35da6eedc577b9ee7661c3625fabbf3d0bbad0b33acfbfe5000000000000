1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,950
对不住了 圣诞老人
Sorry, Santa.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,330
前情提要

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,040
是内森吗 你在干什么 孩子  一切都还好吗 
Nathaniel? What are you doin', buddy? Hey, is everything okay?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,250
他说你不能回家过圣诞节也没关系

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,000
我说回去 就一定回去
Hey. You know I'm gonna be there, like I said.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,910
所以浪人已经死了 杀掉他的人也已经死了
So Ronin is dead, and the person who killed him is dead.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,950
死无对证啊 你怎么知道的 
That's convenient. How do you know this?

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,120
因为我在场
'Cause I was there.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,660
接下来的拍卖品
Up next, we have an artifact

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,250
是来自复仇者联盟基地废墟的遗物
recovered from the wreckage of the Avengers compound.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,750
这块表
The lots.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,330
纽约市的名流阿曼德·杜凯恩
New York socialite Armand Duquesne

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,370
昨晚在他的住所被发现遇害
was found dead in his home last night.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,370
我是纽约市警察局的考德尔探员
This is Detective Caudie of the New York Police Department.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,500
毕肖普小姐 你能来警局一趟吗 
Ms. Bishop, can you come down to the station for a quick chat?

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,500
你说阿曼德是怎么死的 
How'd you say Armand was killed?

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,790
被剑捅死的
Stabbed with a sword.

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,370
看看有没有卡齐的信息
See if there's anything on Kazi.

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,660
好吧 这是什么公司 斯隆有限公司  卡齐是雇员之一 
Okay, what's this company, Sloan Limited? Kazi is an employee?

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,120
我看看能不能查到杰克
Let me see what I can pull up on Jack.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,910
我被强制退出了
And I've just been locked out.

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,200
别动
Don't move.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,080
漫威影业出品

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,750
待在那别动
Stay exactly where you are.

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,450
杰克 不要
Jack, no!

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,370
这是怎么回事 
What the hell is going on?

27
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,750
为什么有个复仇者在我的餐厅里 
And why is there an Avenger in my dining room?

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,200
你好
Hi.

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,540
天啊 你是…你是那个弓箭手
Oh, my God. You're... You're Archer.

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,910
-鹰眼 -克林特
-Hawkeye. -Clint.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,290
-我跟你说过 就是人设问题 -没错
-It's the branding issue, I'm telling you. -Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,910
《鹰眼》
第一季第四集

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,700
鹰眼和我在办案 我们需要用一下洗手间
Hawkeye and I are working on a case, and we needed to use the bathroom.

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,080
是他要用 我们正好经过这里 就顺便进来一下 没什么大事
He did. So, we were by the house, we dropped in. No big deal.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,330
-你们在一起办案  -真厉害啊
-Working on a case together? -How terrific.

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,870
他是我的搭档
He's my partner.

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,250
我们不是搭档
We're not partners.

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,790
我们算是朋友兼搭档
Well, we're friends-slash-partners.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,950
我也不觉得咱们是朋友
I wouldn't really describe us as friends.

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,910
十分钟前有人用我的笔记本 登陆了我的工作帐户
Someone used my laptop to sign onto my work account ten minutes ago.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,580
你知道怎么回事吗 凯特 
Any thoughts, Kate?

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,410
鹰眼 
Hawkeye?

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,700
他什么都不会说的 神箭手不善于与人交流
You'll never get anything outta him. See, CB-One has trouble opening up.

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,120
从来没人叫我神箭手
Nobody calls me CB-One.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,700
我就试着叫一下
I'm just tryin' it out for a second.

46
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,410
可能是有什么童年阴影 他觉得没和我说过什么
Probably some early childhood thing. He thinks he doesn't tell me much,

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,450
-其实他和我说了很多 -我什么都没和她说过
-but he ends up telling me all of it. -I tell her nothing.

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,910
我觉得可能是因为我比较冷静
I think it's 'cause I'm generally pretty chill.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,950
我不会像其他人那样大呼小叫 〝天啊 是鹰眼〟
I'm not like, "Oh, my God, Hawkeye!"

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,250
你可一点都不冷静
Definitely not chill.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,370
我插一句 谢谢你…拯救了世界
By the way, thank you... for saving the world.

52
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,790
不用谢
Don't mention it.

53
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,830
我想听我女儿跟我说实话
I would like my daughter to start telling me the truth.

54
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,410
是我登录了你的帐户 因为我需要信息
I logged into your account because I needed information

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,870
案子是真的 人是真的 他们身处的险境也是真的
on an actual case with actual people who are in actual danger.

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,910
所以 凯特在帮你处理 复仇者级别的威胁 
So, Kate is helping you with an Avengers-level threat?

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,410
也不算是吧
Well, not exactly.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,160
但是你们在一起合作 
But you are working together?

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,580
对 听着有点奇怪 确实奇怪
Yes. Sounds weird, 'cause it is.

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,160
好吧
Okay.

61
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,910
好吧 看来我得相信 大家都在做正确的事
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to trust everyone at this table to do what's right.

62
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,370
好的 很高兴见到你们
Cool. It was great bumpin' into you guys.

63
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,950
-你别走 -我们得走了…
-Please stay. -We should get...

64
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,330
我能送你出去吗 
Can I see you out?

65
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,910
我去拿外衣 杰克 再见
I'll get my coat. Jack.

66
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,950
我得说清楚
Let me clarify.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,910
好
Yeah.

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,080
她可不是什么超级英雄
She is not a superhero.

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,450
是的 我当然知道
Oh, yeah. Come on, I already knew that.

70
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,830
她身手不错 但是…
She's pretty good at all this, but...

71
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,790
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫身手也不错 对吗 
Natasha Romanoff was pretty damn good at it, wasn't she?

72
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,540
身手不错也不一定能保命
Being good isn't always enough to keep you alive.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
我知道了
I see.

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
-克林特  -怎么 
-Clint? -Yeah?

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
你有孩子吗 
Do you have kids?

76
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,080
我就当你有
Yeah, I'm gonna assume that you do.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,290
这一周对我们家而言很煎熬
It's been a rough week for my family.

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,160
但是我必须告诉你 我不能失去凯特
But I am letting you know that I cannot lose Kate.

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,040
我以前失去过亲人 我知道你也有过类似的经历
I've lost people before. I know in your line of work, you have, too.

80
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,200
我明白 好的
I understand. Okay.

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,580
所以你会放弃这个案子 
So, you'll forget this case?

82
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,580
这可不行
I can't do that.

83
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,950
但是我可以保证的是 你女儿一定会安然无恙 好吗 
But what I can do is ensure that your daughter stays safe. Okay?

84
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:30,200
劳拉 帮我查一下〝斯隆有限公司〟好吗

85
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,410
我是埃莉诺
It's Eleanor. Um...

86
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,040
能不能给我回个电话 情况紧急
Could you call me back, please? It's urgent.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,660
你发现什么了吗 
Hey. Did you find anything?

88
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,000
我和你那个朋友聊过了 他很忙
I talked to that friend of yours. He's really busy.

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,410
他一边学俄语 一边还要不停锻炼
He's been learning Russian and jogging a ton.

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,540
运动服黑帮 斯隆是他们的幌子 
Tracksuits. So Sloan is their front?

91
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,540
对 他说他的老板杰克·杜凯恩 从来不让他休息
Yep. He said that his boss, Jack Duquesne, never gives him a day off.

92
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,160
杰克是CEO  他在给他们的老大洗钱 
Jack's CEO? He's laundering money for the big guy?

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,410
我觉得你可能还得多待一天
Let me guess, you're gonna need another day.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,620
是这样 我救了个孩子 她被卷进来了
Yeah, look, uh, this kid I'm helping is stuck in the middle of it,

95
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,450
我得保证她安全以后才能走
so I can't leave until I know she's safe.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,410
我一直在想…
I've been wondering...

97
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,450
基地里还有什么东西不见了吗

98
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,870
你是说劳力士 
You mean the Rolex?

99
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,160
没错

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,830
是爸爸
It's Dad.

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,540
不会吧…我觉得不会吧
I don't think... I don't think so.

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,200
为什么提起这个  那不是好几年前就毁掉了吗 
Why? Wasn't that destroyed, like, years ago?

103
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,950
我也这么觉得 但是你那件炫酷的战服不也一样嘛
Well, I thought so, but I thought the same thing about your fancy outfit.

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,790
看来得调查一下 对吗 
It's worth lookin' into, ain't it?

105
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,540
如果可以的话 查一下发射器的信号
If you can, check the signal from the transmitter.

106
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,700
好的 你说话怎么气喘吁吁的 你累了 
Okay. You sound like you've been runnin' around all day. Are you tired?

107
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,540
是的 我受了点小伤 但是没大事
Yeah, I'm a little banged up, but nothing's broken.

108
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,830
好吧 放松一下
Okay. Well, put your feet up.

109
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,160
有必要就冰敷一下 好吗 我爱你
Ice them if you have to. Okay? I love you.

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,700
我…我很想你
I... I miss you.

111
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,450
我尽快回去 我保证
I'll see you soon. I promise.

112
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
再见
Bye.

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,410
孩子们 看来爸爸还得再忙一阵
Uh, guys, looks like Dad's gonna be stuck at work a little longer.

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,950
她非常痴迷于克林特·巴顿 自从…
Obsessed. Completely obsessed with Clint Barton since...

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,250
自从那次袭击以后
Well, ever since the attack.

116
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,870
她在偶像面前表现得还挺镇定
She's awfully composed around her own idol.

117
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,410
如果能见到休伊·路易斯 我肯定疯了
If I ever met Huey Lewis, I'd be a wreck.

118
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,370
凯特一直都很自信
Kate's always been confident,

119
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,910
这方面她倒从来没让我担心过
never had to worry about her on that front.

120
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,910
你又开始头疼了吧 亲爱的 我给你泡点茶
You're getting that pre-headache look, darling. Let me get you some tea.

121
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,540
你想吃点什么吗 凯特 
Would you like something, Kate?

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,540
不用了 谢谢
No. Thanks.

123
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,160
妈妈 我真的得和你谈谈杰克的事
Mom, I really need to talk to you about Jack.

124
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,450
咱们能不能…换个话题 
Hey, could we... Um... Could we change the subject?

125
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,250
先别管他的事了 来吧
You need to give him a break. Come on.

126
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,580
我需要你帮我决定 毕肖普节日聚会的事
I... I need your help with a few decisions on the Bishop holiday party.

127
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,040
我觉得…我现在没那个心情
I don't... I don't think I'm in the mood.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,540
来吧 凯特 这种事你最擅长了
Come on, Kate. You're great at this sort of thing.

129
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,370
这个聚会不强制宗教信仰
The party's non-denominational,

130
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,500
就是过节了 让大家增进一下感情
encourages company camaraderie with a festive spirit.

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,910
那还真挺有意思的
Sounds like a blast already.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
你们是在聊聚会吗 
Did someone say parties?

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,500
一定要有跳舞环节啊
Just make sure there's plenty of dancing.

134
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,120
我妈妈从来不跳舞
Well, my mother doesn't dance.

135
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,040
真的吗 我看未必 亲爱的 
Oh, really? I beg to differ. Darling?

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,450
篝火上的板栗飘香
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

137
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,370
北风吹拂刺骨冰霜
Jack Frost nippin' at your ear

138
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,410
这句祝福被反复吟唱
And though it's been said many times, many ways

139
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,410
祝你圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas to you

140
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,330
我以前从来没见过你这样
Don't think I've ever seen you like that before.

141
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,450
超级英雄登门拜访 再加上一支小夜曲 这一天真够热闹的
A superhero house call and a serenade, all in one day.

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,870
人们常说 人生苦短
Well, you know what they say... life is short.

143
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,700
你永远不知道会得到什么
You never know what you're gonna get.

144
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,000
怎么了 我说什么了  我是说错了吗…
What? What'd I say? Did I say something wrong or...

145
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,660
这些心灵鸡汤从你嘴里说出来就没对过
Every time you use one of those aphorisms, they are... wrong.

146
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,870
什么 不可能吧 亲爱的 拜托
What? No. That can't be right, is it? Darling. Please.

147
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,580
那天你还说 〝小别催人老〟
The other day, you said, "Absence makes the heart grow older."

148
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,290
事实就是如此啊
Because that's what it does.

149
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,660
-亲爱的 过来 -是吗 
- Yeah. Honey. Come here. - No. Really?

150
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,290
你可真是催我老了
Aw. You're making my heart grow older.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,540
我觉得被家人笑话
I guess getting laughed at by family

152
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,660
总比过节一个人孤零零的好吧 
is better than being alone in the holidays, right?

153
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,450
还有什么比家人团聚更开心的呢  你们都在这里 我真高兴
What's better than being with family? I'm so glad you're both here.

154
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,450
咱们玩桌游吧
You know, we should play a board game.

155
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,830
这主意不错
That's a cute idea.

156
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,290
有好多种可以玩呢
Risk, Yahtzee, Stratego.

157
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,450
是我 我带来了披萨和节日的祝福 给我开门
It's me. I come bearing pizza and holiday cheer. Let me in.

158
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,250
来吧 披萨狗 好吧
Come on, Pizza Do... Okay.

159
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,540
-你好 -你好
-Hey! -Hey.

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,330
-帮个忙  -出去
-A little help? -Hey, get outta there.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,370
这可是我们期待已久的 鹰眼经典战服
All right, this is the classic Hawkeye costume we've been waitin' for.

162
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,620
你这是要干什么 
What is all this?

163
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,700
我这是在拯救你的节日
This is me saving the holidays.

164
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,790
是吗 
Is that right?

165
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,830
我得让你在圣诞节前赶回家去
I'll get you home in time for the big day.

166
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,250
我觉得现在咱们可以先庆祝一下
Figured in the meantime, we could celebrate.

167
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,250
今天是电影马拉松之夜 对吗  看 我带了电影来
It's movie marathon night, right? Check this out. I got movies.

168
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,450
你太贴心了
That's very thoughtful of you.

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
谢谢
Thanks.

170
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,450
但是在开始之前 咱们先聊聊那个剑术小子吧
But yeah, can we put a pause on that and talk about Sword Boy for a minute?

171
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,540
-你的直觉很准 孩子 -什么意思 
-You got good instincts, kid. -What do you mean?

172
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,500
我做了些调查 结果发现
So, I did a little digging and turns out,

173
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
斯隆是个空壳公司 专门给运动服黑帮洗钱
Sloan's a shell company that launders money for the Tracksuits.

174
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,790
杰克·杜凯恩是公司的CEO
And Jack Duquesne is the CEO.

175
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,000
你确定吗 
You sure?

176
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,200
好吧 咱们一边定计划
Okay, well, we're just gonna have to come up with a plan to take down

177
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,200
端掉我妈的未婚夫的犯罪团伙
my mom's fiancé's organized crime ring

178
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,750
一边高高兴兴地过个圣诞节
while simultaneously having a heartwarming holiday celebration.

179
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,910
你那个冰沙还有吗 
Got any more of that slushy stuff?

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,370
-在厨房里 -好
- In the kitchen. - Okay.

181
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,160
警察那边 得想办法让他们别盯着我
Okay, cops. We need to get the cops off my back.

182
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,580
运动服黑帮那边 咱们也得摆脱他们的纠缠
TSM, we need to get them to leave us alone.

183
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,000
咱们还得弄清楚 杰克和这一切有什么关联
And we need to figure out why and how Jack is connected to it all.

184
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,290
没错
Yeah, right.

185
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,870
该轮到你拿出具体计划了
This the part where you finish my sentence with a plan.

186
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,040
我从来不擅长制定计划 你确定那些擦得掉吗 
Planning's not really my thing. Are you sure that's dry erase?

187
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,830
好孩子
Good boy.

188
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,620
哪里能再弄点特殊箭头 
How do we get more trick arrows?

189
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,580
特殊箭头没有了
Well, there are no more trick arrows.

190
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,830
全世界都没有了 
Like in the world?

191
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,000
基本上没有了 我还有些特殊箭头
Basically. I have a few more trick arrowheads.

192
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,580
但是不是随便一个弓就能用的
But you can't just put 'em on any shaft.

193
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,580
咱们得把这些拿回来
So, we really have to get these back.

194
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,200
你在干什么 
What're you doing?

195
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,700
看 圣诞树可以挡住擦不掉的地方
See? Tree covers the parts that won't come off.

196
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,330
你可真会想办法
Well, now you're problem-solving.

197
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,580
-你听说过回旋箭吗  -那是什么 
-Have you ever heard of boomerang arrows? -What?

198
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,040
我要回旋箭干什么 
Why would I ever want to use a boomerang arrow?

199
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,870
-它们能飞回来 -没错
-Because they come back. -Exactly.

200
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,040
如果特殊箭头能飞回来 那就用不完了
Yeah, well, if all trick arrows were boomerangs, then we'd have them all.

201
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,120
飞回来会打到自己
Coming back at us.

202
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,830
你得…你得躲开啊
You'd have to... You'd have to dodge.

203
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,000
不 这不是不可能的
No, it's not impossible.

204
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,200
你射出的第一支箭得是木头的
The first arrow you release just has to be wood.

205
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,080
然后第二支箭把第一支箭从中间劈开
So when you release the second one, it splits it up the middle.

206
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,660
-这是胡扯 我试过 -我这么做过好几次了
-I call bullshit. I've tried it. -Well, I've done it a few times.

207
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,410
你还有其它炫酷的招数吗 
You got any other cool tricks?

208
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,040
我能在6米以外用这个把人打晕
Well, I can knock somebody unconscious with that, like, 20 feet away.

209
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,370
不可能
No, you can't.

210
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,160
得用25美分或5美分的硬币 10美分的太轻了
I'd use a quarter or a nickel. A dime's too light.

211
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,750
露一手看看
Prove it.

212
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,160
把你打晕 
What, knock you unconscious?

213
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,660
当然不是 你打点别的
No, I want you to hit something.

214
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,200
算了 你就带着我的不信任活下去吧
Fine, live forever without me believing you.

215
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,250
我逢人就说 鹰眼只会吹牛
I'll just tell every stranger that I see that Hawkeye is full of bullshit.

216
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,040
你一定得教教我是怎么做的
You've got to show me how you did that.

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,080
准备好了吗 
All right, you ready?

218
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
准备好了
Yeah.

219
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,870
你弹指的手法没问题 要注意弹出去的弧度
You have a nice snap. Make sure you get that curve.

220
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,830
一点弧度就可以 对 明白了吗 
Just a little one. Right, you got it, right?

221
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,700
天啊
Oh, God.

222
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,950
你是怎么弄的 
What are you doing?

223
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,870
用无名指
Ring finger.

224
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,750
-紧紧捏住 -好的
-Grip it tight. -Yeah.

225
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,700
好点了
That was better.

226
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,790
这次肯定没问题
You can do it this time.

227
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,500
好吧
Okay.

228
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,330
-天啊 -什么 
- Oh, my God! - What?

229
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,040
-天啊 我成功了 -太棒了
-Holy shit, I did it. -Yes.

230
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,700
太厉害了
That was crazy.

231
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,830
还不错 孩子
Hey, not bad, kid.

232
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,540
当然不错 你射的最好的一箭是哪一次 
Not bad. All right. Best shot you ever took?

233
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,790
-是我没射出去的那一箭 -什么意思 
-Uh, the one I didn't take. -What does that mean?

234
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,040
意思就是…无所谓了 我就不该提
Uh, it means... Never mind, shouldn't have said it.

235
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,660
-别啊 你不能这样 -无所谓 那不重要
-Oh, come on, you can't do that. -Never mind, it's nothin'.

236
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
什么 不行 就当是给我的圣诞礼物
What? Come on, consider it my Christmas present.

237
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,580
-不行 -行
-No, it's not the right time. -Yes.

238
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,910
-我觉得肯定是个精彩的故事 -不是什么精彩的故事 好吗 
-Look, it'll be a good story, I'm sure... -It's just not a good story, okay?

239
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,700
那是…
It's...

240
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,700
我遇到某人的时候
about the time I met someone.

241
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,450
我被派去干掉她
I was sent to take her out.

242
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,000
到那以后 我有机会出手的时候
And when I got there, when it was time...

243
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,120
我下不了手
I couldn't do it.

244
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
我有一种感觉 她想摆脱那一切
I just had this feeling that she wanted out.

245
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,250
结果我是对的
Turns out, I was right.

246
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,500
你是说娜塔莎
You mean Natasha.

247
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,200
是的
Yeah.

248
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,120
她是最出色的
She was the best there was.

249
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,160
抱歉
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,580
没关系 只是…干我们这一行的
It's all right. It's, uh... When you do what I do for a living, it...

251
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,700
就得学会面对各种生离死别 对吗  所以…
It's just a game of managing loss, right? So...

252
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,870
孩子们 杰尼 汤米
Kids, Janie, Janie, Tommy!

253
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,160
你真可爱 我真是太喜欢你了
Look at you. Oh, I could eat you up.

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,540
-妈妈在哪  -她去找你了
- Where's your mother? - She went looking for you.

255
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,370
你在烁灭中失去了家人吗 
You lost your family in the Blip?

256
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,200
是的 和全世界一半人一样
Yeah. Like half the world.

257
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,410
天啊 那肯定是悲痛欲绝
God, that must have been devastating.

258
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,160
对 我不知道该怎么表达
Yeah, there are no words.

259
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,950
你就是那时遇到浪人的吗 
Is that where you met the Ronin?

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,540
浪人就是你 对吗 
It's you, isn't it?

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,080
每个人都有自己应对烁灭的方式
Everybody dealt with the Blip in their own way.

262
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,950
我就继续做我被训练去做的事
I continued doing what I was trained to do.

263
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,540
保护人们
Protect people.

264
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,500
伤害人们 开始是调查
Hurting people. Investigating first,

265
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,950
但是到最后 我的工作永远是伤害别人
but in the end, my job has always been to hurt people.

266
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,200
你是个英雄
You were a hero.

267
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,500
我是个杀人工具
I was a weapon.

268
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,290
只不过在正确的人手里 去对付正确的目标罢了
I was aimed by the right people at the right targets, so...

269
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,000
你犯了错误 但是那些都过去了
Look, you made mistakes, but those are behind you.

270
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
不 它一直萦绕在我身边
No, it's tied to me.

271
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,410
萦绕在我的家人身边
Tied to my family.

272
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,700
这就是为什么我在这里 没有解决问题之前 我不能回去
That's why I'm here. And I can't go home till I fix it.

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,290
很感谢你今晚为我做的事
I really appreciate what you did tonight.

274
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
对我很重要
It means a lot.

275
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,200
你应该好好休息一下 明天很重要
You know, you should get some rest. You got a big day tomorrow.

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,620
是的 老大 晚安
-Yes, boss. Good night. -'Night.

277
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,870
-晚安 -来吧
Come on!

278
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,540
现在呢 
How about now?

279
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,040
杀掉这些人也不能让你的家人复生
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

280
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,120
没事的
It's okay.

281
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,450
求你了
Please.

282
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,870
不要
No!

283
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,910
离圣诞节只有三天了
It's three days until Christmas

284
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,700
我们为你准备好了圣诞歌曲
and we've got your soundtrack for the holiday season.

285
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,620
你正在收听的是107.6纽约轻松调频
You're listening to New York's 107.6, light FM.

286
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,290
-早上好 -早上好

287
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
-来点咖啡 -太好了
-Some coffee. -Oh, thank God.

288
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,620
今天早上我要去和老朋友卡齐聊聊
Okay, this morning, I'm gonna have a talk with our friend, Kazi.

289
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,620
你去帮我 从那帮真人角色扮演的朋友那里
What I want you to do is track down the trick arrows

290
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,950
把特殊箭头取回来
from our friends, the LARPers.

291
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,000
-等等 什么  -我的追踪箭不动了
-Wait, what? -My tracer arrow stopped moving,

292
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,500
它在纽约警局一个桥下的仓库里
and it's over by an NYPD facility down by the bridge.

293
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,450
真人角色扮演的那群人 大多数都是应急响应成员 有一个是警察
And now the LARPers, they're mostly first responders, one's a cop.

294
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,290
看看他们能不能进入那个仓库
See if they can get access to that NYPD facility.

295
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,200
真人角色扮演的朋友们
LARPer friends.

296
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,250
对 他们特别炫酷 你会喜欢他们的
Yeah, they're... They're colorful. You're gonna love 'em.

297
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,000
我觉得那些应该算是咱们的箭头
You know, I like to think of them more as our arrows.

298
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,370
好吧 去把咱们的箭头取回来
Okay. Go get our arrows.

299
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,370

302
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,790

303
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,410
神力一击
Superpower Doom!

304
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,450
我…不好意思打断一下
Hey, I, uh... I don't mean to interrupt...

305
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,540
-你们… -后退
- Wow. You guys are... - Retreat!

306
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
真投入
Dedicated.

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,370
你是谁
Who are you?

308
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,700
鹰眼让我来处理些复仇者联盟的事
Uh, Hawkeye sent me here on official Avengers business.

309
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,910
我是他的搭档兼好朋友凯特
I'm his partner-slash-best-friend, Kate.

310
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,830
他说你们能帮他 这里有谁是警察吗 
He said you guys could help us out. One of you is a cop?

311
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,950
我就是 我是温蒂·康莱德警官 现在我是深谷的艾尔斯·巴斯
That's me, Officer Wendy Conrad. Better as Els-Bath of Deepdale.

312
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,370
警官您好 其实我们需要的
Officer. Basically, all we need is some

313
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,620
就是对证物做一点点 微不足道的篡改
casual, run-of-the-mill evidence tampering.

314
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,200
鹰眼的特殊箭头在曼哈顿桥附近的 纽约警局仓库里
Hawkeye's trick arrows are in an NYPD facility near the Manhattan Bridge.

315
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
我也许可以帮助你
I can probably help you out

316
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
但是你得给我点好处
if you make it worth my while.

317
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,620
还有我们的好处
Worth our while.

318
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,160
好的 完全没问题 要什么都可以 好的
Yeah. Yeah, sure, totally. Whatever you want. All right.

319
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,660
都来吗 好 肯定很有趣
All in? Okay. This is gonna be great.

320
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,750
你们太厉害了 这些服装… 真的很厉害
You guys are awesome, outfits, the... It's just really awesome.

321
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,540
意外吗 我就是想谈谈
Surprise. Ah, ah. Just wanna talk.

322
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,290
我要离开这个城市
I need to get out of the city.

323
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,450
但是在走之前 我得解决浪人的问题
But before I go, I need to put this Ronin situation to bed.

324
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,620
我知道玛雅听你的
Look, I know you have Maya's ear,

325
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,250
你看上去是个讲道理的家伙 也不蠢
and you seem like you're a reasonably not stupid guy.

326
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,790
你要是想奉承我 那可差点意思
If you're tryin' to flatter me, you are way off the mark.

327
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,870
别误会 我觉得你就是个跟班
Don't get me wrong, I think you're a doormat.

328
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,290
你在威廉·洛佩兹手下
Look, you've been working under

329
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,500
做了几年小头目 有四年吗 
William Lopez as a lieutenant for, what, for four years?

330
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,250
现在又跟着玛雅干了几年
And now under Maya for a few more years.

331
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,910
你比任何人都了解这里的情况
You know this operation better than anybody.

332
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
你知道玛雅的老板想要什么
You know what Maya's boss wants.

333
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,200
你也知道为了达到目标 他都做了些什么
And you know what he's already done to get it.

334
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,500
你知道什么 
So what do you know?

335
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,910
我知道他不喜欢引人注目 这是肯定的
I know he doesn't like this attention, that's for sure.

336
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,450
我知道玛雅想追捕浪人的执念 是很危险的
I know Maya's obsession, wanting to hunt Ronin down, is dangerous.

337
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,370
那会干扰她的判断 你说呢 
Clouds her judgment, don't you think?

338
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,620
所以你在担心这个组织 还有…我的位置 
So you're concerned for the organization? And, uh... And my rank in it?

339
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
你想要什么 
What do you want?

340
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,080
我不想闹出任何人命
I don't want anybody else to die.

341
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,410
但是玛雅的复仇心态会让她送命
But Maya's need for vengeance is gonna get her killed.

342
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,910
就是这样
Period.

343
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,580
你在找这个吗  还是座位下面的匕首 
Looking for this? Or maybe it's the box cutter under the seat.

344
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,830
你说完了吗 
Look, are we done here?

345
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,700
她在追捕的是一个幽灵
She's chasing a ghost.

346
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,330
我觉得你明白 但是我没法说服她
I think you know that. But I can't convince her of that.

347
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,700
我认为你是唯一能说服她的人
And I'm guessing you're the only one who can.

348
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,200
这是最后的警告 你看着办
This is the final warning. Just get it done.

349
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,870
能把枪还给我吗 
Hey, can I have my gun back?

350
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,410
你想什么呢 
Yeah, what do you think?

351
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,750
该死
Ah, come on.

352

357
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,200
很好 我觉得比你那边还顺利
Great, yeah. Better than yours, I'd say.

358
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,620
拿到我的装备了吗 
So did you, uh, get my gear?

359
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,290
拿到了 正在来的路上
Yeah, yeah. They're on the way.

360
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,700

They should be here any minute. Yeah, relax.

361
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,500
-什么  -你看看
-What? -Check that out.

362
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,830
说实话 我穿维京服饰还挺好看的
Not gonna lie, I look pretty good as a Viking.

363
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,410
-你知道吗 这都是我自己做的 -不可能
-I... You know, I made this myself. -No way!

364
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,290
-纯手工的 -你能不能帮我做一件
-By hand. -Could I hire you to make my next one?

365
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,410
当然可以
Oh, yeah. I would love to.

366
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,870
等等 要不咱们谈个条件 
Hey, wait a second. What if that's our deal?

367
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,370
-什么条件  -我们帮你拿到箭头和情报
-What deal? -We get you the arrows and info,

368
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,950
你帮我们找点做新衣服的材料
and you get us materials for a new costume.

369
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,700
这样吧 给你们足够的材料做衣服 你们再多做两件行不行 
Okay, how about enough materials to make your costumes plus two more?

370
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,750
我知道有人也需要帮忙做衣服
I know a certain someone who needs a little help with theirs.

It was stolen from a black market auction. I need it back.

397
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,750
没有亮灯 也没有人
No lights, no movement.

398
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,910
机不可失
This is our chance.

399
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,000
在更高的屋顶上可能更容易进去
This would have been easier if we were on a higher rooftop.

400
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,120
那是你的想法
That's what you think.

401
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,370
对 没错 要不我这么说呢
Yeah, exactly. That's why I said it.

402
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,120
凯特 永远要首先想怎么快速脱身 然后才是怎么快速进场
Kate, you always wanna prioritize a quick exit over a quick entrance

403
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,910
如果事情出了偏差 这是常事
so when things go sideways, and they usually do,

404
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,660
你就做好了脱身的准备 所以我才选择了这个位置
you have an exit strategy. That's why I chose this spot.

405
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,160
我在这里能看到所有的出口
It's got good sightlines for all my exits.

406
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,830
进去很容易 大概花个
Entry should be easy.

407
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,000
三分半钟就能进去
Think it should take me about three and a half minutes to get in.

408
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,750
如果你看见什么异常情况 给我个信号 凯特 好吗 
So, if you see anything out here, just give me a signal, Kate. All right?

409
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,410
凯特 
Kate?

410
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,580
你干什么呢 
What're you doin?

411
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,750
凯特 
Kate? Kate?

412
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,500
-不客气 -我说了你是负责盯梢的
-There you are. -I told you you're supposed to be lookout.

413
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,950
对 但是咱们两个里 你觉得 谁在那上面注意力更集中 
Yeah, but of the two of us, who do you trust up there not to get distracted?

414
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,750
这不公平 你仗着自己是个孩子
That's not fair, that your inability

415
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,910
就这样随心所欲胡搅蛮缠
to act like a grown-up helps you get your way.

416
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,330
是不公平 但是这不就是人生嘛
No, it's not. But it is what it is.

417
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,370
你得用钩索箭把自己荡进去
I need you to use your grappling hook arrow to anchor yourself in.

418
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,620
从建筑的一侧移动到窗户那里
Propel down the side of the building to the window.

419
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,410
如果锁住了 就轻轻地把它打碎
If it's locked, break in quietly.

420
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,870
好的 计划不错 天衣无缝 但是需要一点点调整
Yeah, love all of that. Great plan, just a slight tweak though.

421
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,620
晚上好 先生 我来帮你拿包吧
Good evening, sir. Can I help you with your bags?

422
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,290
-谢谢你 -没事
- Oh. Thank you. - Sure.

423
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,910
你在干什么…不
What are you... No, no, no.

424
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,160
不行 别惊动别人
No, no, no. Don't... Don't engage.

425
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,580
-你买了芹菜 还有麦片 -凯特
- Got celery, a little Kashi. - Kate.

426
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,870
还有椒盐面包 
Okay, some pretzels?

427
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,000
你在哪 
Where are you?

428
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,370
别紧张 我在电梯里
Oh, relax. I'm taking the elevator.

429
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,700
不好意思 你说什么 
I'm sorry, what was that?

430
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,580
抱歉 我没和您说话
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry, I wasn't talking to you.

431
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,540
我告诉你个秘密吧 
Can I tell you a secret?

432
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,870
别这么做
Please don't do this.

433
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,750
我在和一个复仇者通话
I was talking to an Avenger.

434
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,160
我们用耳机联络
He's in my ear.

435
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,750
你应该闭嘴了
Maybe you should stop talking.

436
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,330
对 我是他的搭档
Yeah, I'm his partner.

437
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,910
把这个还给我吧
I'll just take this back.

438
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,160
我能帮您拿到门口的 没关系
I can help you to the door, no problem.

439
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,700
不用了 给我就行了
No, that's all right. I got it from here.

440
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,120
好吧 你确定吗 真的没关系的
Okay, are you sure? It's really no problem.

441
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,830
好吧 您多小心
All right, you take care now.

442
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,500
弓这么大你平时怎么处理啊
What do you do with this giant bow problem?

443
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,410
我有个可折叠的
I have a collapsible one.

444
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,870
原来如此
Oh, that makes sense.

445
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,250
好吧 我到门口了
Okay. I'm at the door.

446
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,370
没有异常
We're good.

447
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,500
好的 客厅没问题
Okay. Living room's all clear.

448
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,410
该死
Oh, shit.

449
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,790
怎么了 
What was that?

450
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,660
我不知道 墙上好像有频闪灯
I don't know. There are, like, strobe lights attached to the wall.

451
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,580
-什么频闪灯  -我不知道
- What do you mean, strobe lights? - I don't know.

452
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,660
你看见什么了 
Yeah, what do you see?

453
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,250
好吧 我要找什么 
Okay, what am I lookin' for?

454
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,620
一块表 古董劳力士
A watch, vintage Rolex.

455
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,370
是我以前的同事的
Belongs to someone I used to work with.

456
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,450
就这点信息吗 克林特 
Is that the whole story, Clint?

457
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,410
他们已经退出很多年了
They've been out of the game a long time,

458
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,830
但是他们的身份都储存在那块表里
but their identity is still attached to that watch.

459
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,250
如果被运动服黑帮发现了呢 
Hmm. And if the Tracksuits find out about it?

460
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
他们的身份就会曝光 那些朋友就永别了
It would blow their cover. Goodbye, friend.

461
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,370
拿到手表了
Got the watch.

462
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
太好了
Great.

463
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,910
等等
Hang on a minute.

464
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,750
克林特 有人在记录你的家人
Clint, somebody is taking notes on your family.

465
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,870
什么 
What?

466
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,410
〝克林特·巴顿 妻子劳拉 女儿莱拉 14岁〟
"Clint Barton, wife, Laura, daughter, Lila, age 14,

467
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,330
〝儿子 库珀 16岁 内特〟 这是…
"son, Cooper, age 16, son, Nate." What...

468
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,290
凯特 赶紧出来
Kate, get out of there now.

469
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,080
什么 为什么 
What? Why?

470
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,540
那个灯是个警报 是给聋哑人用的无声警报
That light's an alarm. It's a silent alarm for people that can't hear.

471
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,790
天啊
Oh, my God.

472
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,950
这是玛雅的公寓
It's Maya's apartment.

473
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,750
好吧 我来了…
All right, I'm coming...

474
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,620
克林特 怎么了 
Clint, what's going on?

475
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,330
克林特 
Clint?

476
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,790
玛雅在这
Maya's here.

477
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,200
对 我看见了
Yeah, I can see that.

478
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,410
你为什么不告诉我 
Then why didn't you tell me?

479
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,450
我告诉你了 玛雅和我在屋顶上
I did. Maya's on the roof with me.

480
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,290
不对 玛雅分明在这里
No, Maya is definitely here.

481
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,750
那和我打斗的是谁 
Well, who the hell am I fighting then?

482
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,660
需要帮忙吗 
A little help?

483
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,660
等我一下 来了
Give me a second. Incoming.

484
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,950
到钩索上去
Get on the zip line.

485
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,870
这下好了
Oh, this is great.

486
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,120
快啊
Come on. Come on.

487
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,410
疼死了
That hurt.

488
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,910
不要
No, no, no! No, no!

489
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
把我拉上去
Pull me up!

490
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,500
赶紧走
Get outta here.

491
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,410
那是什么人 
Who the hell was that?

492
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,000
你没必要知道 凯特
You don't wanna know, Kate.

493
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,830
你不告诉我怎么回事 咱们没法做搭档
I cannot be your partner if you don't tell me what's going on.

494
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,330
你不是我的搭档 你明白吗 
You're not my partner. Do you understand that?

495
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,290
你从来都不是
You never were.

496
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,250
有人雇佣了黑寡妇来当刺客
Someone has hired a Black Widow assassin.

497
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,750
情况很严重 很紧急
This has gotten very real, very quickly.

498
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,500
我得自己行动了
So I'm doing this alone.

499
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,700
不行 你不能这么做
No, you're not.

500
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,000
我知道今天晚上确实出了些意外 但是我是自愿来的
Look, I know that tonight didn't go as planned, but I chose to be here.

501
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,910
我知道有风险 我都知道
I understand the risk, I understand all of that.

502
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,290
我不能这么做
I'm not gonna do it.

503
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,120
你听见了吗 
Do you hear me?

504
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,450
你听见了吗 
Do you hear me?

505
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,830
回家吧 凯特 结束了
Go home, Kate. It's over.
